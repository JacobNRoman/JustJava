JustJava android app for Udacity's Android Basics - User Input course

It is a simple app designed to represent an interface for ordering coffee, with a name entry field, interactive buttons for increasing and decreasing the number of coffees ordered, checkboxes for toppings,  and a price calculator. When an order is submitted the app uses an intent to bring up the user's email client and creates an email with a custom subject and body text. The app also features spanish language localization.
